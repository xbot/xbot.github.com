1000-digit Fibonacci number
---------------------------

The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence relation:

Fn = Fn−1 + Fn−2, where F1 = 1 and F2 = 1.

Hence the first 12 terms will be:

>F1 = 1  
F2 = 1  
F3 = 2  
F4 = 3  
F5 = 5  
F6 = 8  
F7 = 13  
F8 = 21  
F9 = 34  
F10 = 55  
F11 = 89  
F12 = 144

The 12th term, F12, is the first term to contain three digits.

What is the first term in the Fibonacci sequence to contain 1000 digits?

Solution
--------

To be progmatic, take the brute-force approach. 

Furthermore, [here](http://www.geekality.net/2009/11/06/project-euler-problem-25/) gives a formula which solves this problem, but it's too mathematical.
